# PRODIGY_ML_04
This project builds an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and an SVM classifier to train on image features. The model is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix, and includes image preprocessing using OpenCV.
